# Teacher's Guide to Requesting Changes

## Welcome Teachers!

This guide helps you request changes to the Mergington High School activities website without needing to understand programming. Our automated coding assistant will handle the technical implementation based on your detailed requests.

## How to Request Changes

1. **Go to the Issues section** of this repository
2. **Click "New Issue"** 
3. **Choose the right template** for your request (see below)
4. **Fill out ALL sections** - the more detail you provide, the better!
5. **Submit your request** - the coding assistant will be automatically assigned

## Available Request Types

### 🎯 Add New Activity/Club
Use when you want to add a completely new extracurricular activity or club to the system.

**Example uses:**
- Adding "Drama Club" for theater students
- Creating "Spanish Honor Society" for advanced language students
- Adding seasonal activities like "Winter Sports"

### ✏️ Modify Existing Activity
Use when you need to change details about an activity that already exists.

**Example uses:**
- Changing Chess Club from Mondays to Tuesdays
- Increasing the capacity of Programming Class from 20 to 25 students
- Updating the description of Soccer Team

### 👥 Student Registration Management
Use when you need new features or fixes for how students sign up for activities.

**Example uses:**
- "I want to register multiple students at once from a list"
- "Students should be able to cancel their own registrations"
- "I need a waitlist for popular activities"

### 🐛 Bug Report
Use when something is broken or not working correctly.

**Example uses:**
- "Login page doesn't work on my phone"
- "Students aren't being added to the Chess Club participant list"
- "The schedule shows wrong times"

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvement
Use when you want the website to look better or be easier to use.

**Example uses:**
- "Make the website easier to use on mobile phones"
- "The activity cards are hard to read - make them more colorful"
- "Add search functionality to find activities faster"

### 🚀 General Feature Request
Use for any other new functionality you want added.

**Example uses:**
- "Send email notifications when new activities are added"
- "Generate reports of student participation"
- "Add calendar integration"

## Tips for Success

### ✅ DO:
- **Be specific**: Instead of "make it better", say "make the text larger and add colors to distinguish different activity types"
- **Provide context**: Explain why you need the change and how it will help
- **Include examples**: Reference specific activities, times, or user scenarios
- **Fill out all required fields**: This ensures the coding assistant has enough information

### ❌ DON'T:
- Leave sections blank - even if they seem optional, more detail is always better
- Use technical jargon - explain what you want in plain language
- Rush the form - take time to think through your requirements
- Submit duplicate requests - check if someone else has already requested something similar

## What Happens Next?

1. **Automatic Assignment**: The coding assistant (@copilot) will be automatically assigned to your issue
2. **Implementation**: The assistant will analyze your requirements and implement the changes
3. **Updates**: You'll receive notifications as progress is made on your request
4. **Completion**: Once implemented, you'll be notified and can test the changes
